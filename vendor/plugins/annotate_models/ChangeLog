  * Don't annotate abstract models

  * Fix bug where we corrupted the PREFIX string and therefore duplicated
    the header
  * No longer include the datetime, so we don't trigger a commit
    back into repos
    
    -- NOTE -- just this once, you'll get a duplicate header after you run
    a_m on an already-annotated model. Sorry.... Dave

  * lib/annotate_models.rb: At Kian Wright's suggestion, document the table
    name and primary key. Also make the timestamp prettier

	* lib/annotate_models.rb: Use camelize, not classify, to construct
	  class names (Grant Hollingworth)

3/3/06   Now annotates fixture files too (thanks to Josha Susser)
